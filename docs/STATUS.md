## What's NOT Done

- No analytics (decision: Umami self-hosted)
- No custom domain configured (DNS + Railway — manual step)
- No Google Search Console submission
- Resend API key not configured (manual: see `docs/ben.md`)
- Affiliate URLs are placeholders (`#`)
- AdSense publisher ID not set (pending approval)
- Placeholder PDF needs real content
- Personal Finance category shows "Coming Soon"
- Only 4 of 16 calculators have custom OG images (SVG)
- SVG OG images may not render on all social platforms (PNG preferred)

## Known Pre-existing TS Warnings

These are non-blocking (build passes) but exist in the codebase:
- `getInitialState` returns `Record<string, unknown>` — doesn't match specific input types
- Some calculators pass `suffix` prop to `SliderInput` which doesn't exist in the type
- Some calculators use `highlighted` prop instead of `highlight` on `ResultCard`/`ResultBreakdown`
- `formatCompactNumber` imported but unused in YouTubeAdSenseCalc

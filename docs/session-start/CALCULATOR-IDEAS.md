- Avoid: Keywords dominated by major finance sites
- Good sign: Generic or outdated tools ranking

- Target: Calculator-specific queries

### 4. Monetization Potential
- Finance calculators → Higher CPM
- B2B calculators → Lead gen potential
- Tool-adjacent → Affiliate opportunities

### 5. Build Complexity

- Medium: Multiple scenarios, conditionals (2-4 hours)
- Complex: External data, many edge cases (4+ hours)
- Start simple, add complexity later

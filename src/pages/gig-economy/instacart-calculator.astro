    answer:

    question: 'How does Instacart pay work?',
    answer:

  },
  {
    question: 'What expenses should Instacart shoppers track?',
    answer:
      'Key expenses include gas, car maintenance, phone/data plan, insulated bags, and car insurance. You can deduct mileage (currently $0.67/mile for 2024) or actual vehicle expenses on your taxes. Keep receipts and track everything!',
  },
  {
    question: 'When are the best times to do Instacart?',
    answer:
      'Peak earning times are typically weekend mornings (8-11am), Sunday afternoons, and weekday evenings (5-8pm). Holidays and bad weather often bring surge pricing and better tips. Avoid slow periods like weekday mid-afternoons.',
  },
  {
    question: 'Should I accept every batch?',
    answer:
      'No! Cherry-picking batches is key to maximizing earnings. Look for good tip-to-item ratios, reasonable distances, and avoid multi-batch orders with poor tips. A good rule: aim for at least $1 per item or $20+ total per batch.',

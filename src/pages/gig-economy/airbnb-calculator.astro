    question: 'How much can you make with Airbnb?',
    answer:
      'Profit varies wildly by location, property type, and occupancy. A spare room might net $500-1,500/month, while a full property in a desirable location can profit $2,000-5,000+/month. Subtract all expenses—many hosts overestimate profits by ignoring cleaning, supplies, and wear.',
  },
  {
    question: 'What is a good Airbnb occupancy rate?',
    answer:
      'Professional hosts target 50-70% occupancy. Above 80% might mean you\'re underpriced. Below 40% often indicates pricing or listing issues. Occupancy varies seasonally—beach properties peak in summer, ski areas in winter.',
  },
  {
    question: 'How much does Airbnb take from hosts?',
    answer:
      'Most hosts pay a 3% service fee per booking. Some markets use "simplified pricing" with 14-16% host fees (but lower guest fees). Payment processing is included. Compare with VRBO (3-5%) and Booking.com (15%) fees.',
  },
  {
    question: 'What are typical Airbnb expenses?',
    answer:
      'Budget for: cleaning ($50-150/turnover), supplies ($100-200/month), utilities increase ($50-200/month), linens/towels replacement ($50-100/month), maintenance reserve (5-10% of revenue), and insurance ($100-300/month for STR coverage).',

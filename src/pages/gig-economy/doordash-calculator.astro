    question: 'Is DoorDash worth it after gas?',
    answer:
      'It depends on your vehicle efficiency and local gas prices. At $3.50/gal and 25 MPG, gas costs about $0.14/mile. For a 5-mile delivery earning $7, gas costs $0.70—still profitable. Use a fuel-efficient car and minimize dead miles to maximize earnings.',

    question: 'How do I track mileage for DoorDash taxes?',
    answer:
      'Use apps like Everlance, Stride, or MileIQ to automatically track miles. The IRS allows $0.67/mile deduction in 2024. Track from when you turn on the app until you\'re done—including driving to hotspots. Keep records for 3 years.',

    question: 'How much can I realistically make from a side hustle?',
    answer:
      'This varies widely based on your skills and time investment. Freelancers typically earn $25-100+/hour depending on expertise. With 10 hours per week at $25/hour after expenses, you could save around $800-1000/month. Skilled professionals in tech or finance can earn significantly more.',
  },
  {
    question: 'How do I calculate my side hustle hourly rate?',
    answer:
      'Track your total earnings and divide by hours worked, including admin time. For project-based work, estimate hours per project. Remember to subtract expenses and set aside 20-30% for taxes to get your true net hourly rate.',
  },
  {
    question: 'Should I reinvest side hustle income back into the business?',
    answer:
      "It depends on your goals. Early on, reinvesting in tools, training, and marketing can accelerate growth. Once established, you might save more toward your goal. A common approach is to reinvest 10-20% while saving the rest.",
  },
  {
    question: "What's a realistic growth rate for a side hustle?",
    answer:
      'Most side hustles can grow 3-10% monthly through rate increases and efficiency gains. Exceptional growth (15%+) is possible but usually requires significant time investment or a scalable business model. Be conservative in your projections.',

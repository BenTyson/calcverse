    question: 'What is the difference between W2 and 1099?',
    answer:
      'A W2 employee works for a company that withholds taxes, provides benefits, and pays the employer portion of payroll taxes. A 1099 contractor is self-employed, responsible for their own taxes, benefits, and business expenses. Contractors typically have more flexibility but less job security.',
  },
  {
    question: 'How much more should I charge as a 1099 contractor?',
    answer:
      'Most financial advisors recommend charging 15-30% more as a contractor to account for self-employment tax (15.3%), health insurance costs, lack of paid time off, and missing employer benefits like 401k matching. Use this calculator to find your specific break-even point.',
  },
  {
    question: 'What is self-employment tax?',
    answer:
      'Self-employment tax is the Social Security and Medicare tax that self-employed individuals pay. It\'s currently 15.3% (12.4% Social Security + 2.9% Medicare). As an employee, your employer pays half of this; as a contractor, you pay the full amount but can deduct half on your taxes.',
  },
  {
    question: 'What benefits should I factor into a W2 vs 1099 comparison?',
    answer:
      'Consider health insurance (often $500-2000/month for self-coverage), 401k employer match (typically 3-6% of salary), paid time off (2-4 weeks), life and disability insurance, professional development budgets, and equipment provided by employers.',
  },
  {
    question: 'Can I deduct expenses as a 1099 contractor?',
    answer:
      'Yes! As a contractor, you can deduct legitimate business expenses including home office costs, equipment, software, professional development, business travel, and health insurance premiums. These deductions reduce your taxable income.',

    question: 'How do I calculate my freelance hourly rate?',
    answer:
      'Start with your desired annual take-home income, add taxes (self-employment + income tax), business expenses, and a profit margin. Divide by your annual billable hours (weekly billable hours × weeks worked) to get your minimum hourly rate.',
  },
  {
    question: 'What expenses should I factor into my freelance rate?',
    answer:
      'Include software subscriptions, equipment, insurance, marketing costs, professional development, home office expenses, and any other costs of running your business. A common mistake is forgetting to account for health insurance if you\'re self-employed.',
  },
  {
    question: 'How many billable hours should I expect per week?',
    answer:
      'Most freelancers can realistically bill 25-35 hours per week. The rest goes to admin tasks, marketing, invoicing, client communication, and professional development. New freelancers often overestimate billable time.',
  },
  {
    question: 'Should I charge different rates for different clients?',
    answer:
      'Yes, many successful freelancers use value-based pricing. You might charge more for rush jobs, complex projects, or clients where your work generates significant ROI. Some freelancers also offer retainer discounts for long-term clients.',

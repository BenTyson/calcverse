    question: 'How much does YouTube pay per 1,000 views?',
    answer:
      'YouTube pays creators through RPM (Revenue Per Mille), which typically ranges from $1-$10 per 1,000 views. However, this varies dramatically based on your niche, audience location, and engagement. Finance channels can earn $15-30+ per 1,000 views, while gaming channels might earn $2-5.',
  },
  {
    question: 'What niches have the highest YouTube CPM?',
    answer:
      'Finance, investing, and business content typically have the highest CPMs ($8-30+), followed by technology ($5-20), health and fitness ($5-18), and education ($4-15). Gaming and entertainment tend to have lower CPMs ($2-10) but often make up for it with higher view counts.',
  },
  {
    question: 'How do I increase my YouTube RPM?',
    answer:
      'Focus on high-value niches, create longer videos (8+ minutes) to enable mid-roll ads, build an audience in high-CPM countries (US, UK, Canada), improve watch time and engagement, and ensure your content is advertiser-friendly. Avoid controversial topics that might limit ads.',
  },
  {
    question: 'When can I start earning money on YouTube?',

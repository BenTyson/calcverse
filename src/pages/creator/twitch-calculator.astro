    question: 'How much do Twitch streamers make per subscriber?',
    answer:
      'Twitch streamers typically receive 50% of the subscription price. For a $4.99 Tier 1 sub, that\'s about $2.50. Top Partners with negotiated contracts may receive up to 70% ($3.50 per sub). Tier 2 ($9.99) and Tier 3 ($24.99) subs pay proportionally more.',
  },
  {
    question: 'How do Twitch bits work for streamers?',
    answer:
      'Streamers receive $0.01 per bit. So 1,000 bits = $10 for the streamer. Unlike subscriptions, Twitch takes their cut from the viewer when they purchase bits, so streamers get 100% of the bit value. Bits are a great source of revenue from non-subscribers.',
  },
  {
    question: 'How much can I make from Twitch ads?',
    answer:
      'Ad revenue varies based on viewer count, viewer location, and ad frequency. Small streamers (50-100 viewers) might earn $2-5 per hour of streaming. Larger streamers with thousands of viewers can earn significantly more. Running more ads increases revenue but may hurt viewer experience.',
  },
  {
    question: 'What\'s the difference between Affiliate and Partner?',
    answer:
      'Affiliates get access to subscriptions, bits, and some ad revenue with a standard 50/50 split. Partners get additional benefits like custom emote slots, squad streaming, and importantly - the ability to negotiate a better revenue split (up to 70/30). Partner status requires consistent viewership.',
  },
  {
    question: 'How do Twitch Prime subs affect my revenue?',
    answer:
      'Prime Gaming (formerly Twitch Prime) subscriptions pay the same as Tier 1 subs ($2.50 on standard split). Viewers with Amazon Prime can subscribe to one channel per month for free. These count toward your sub count and Affiliate/Partner requirements.',

    question: 'How much does Etsy take per sale?',
    answer:
      'Etsy takes approximately 10-12% per sale in standard fees: $0.20 listing fee, 6.5% transaction fee, and 3% + $0.25 payment processing. If you use Etsy Ads or Offsite Ads, fees can reach 20-25% or more.',
  },
  {
    question: 'What is Etsy\'s offsite ads fee?',
    answer:
      'Offsite Ads is Etsy\'s program where they advertise your products on Google, Facebook, Instagram, and other platforms. You\'re charged 12% (or 15% for shops earning $10k+/year) only when a sale results from these ads. Shops under $10k can opt out.',
  },
  {
    question: 'How do I price items on Etsy to make a profit?',
    answer:
      'A good formula: (Item Cost + Shipping Cost + Desired Profit) / (1 - Fee Rate). For example, if your costs are $10 and you want $15 profit with 12% fees: ($10 + $15) / 0.88 = $28.41. Always account for all Etsy fees in your pricing.',
  },
  {
    question: 'Are Etsy fees worth it?',
    answer:
      'Etsy provides access to millions of buyers actively searching for handmade and vintage items. While fees are higher than self-hosted stores, the built-in traffic and trust often make it worthwhile, especially for new sellers. Many successful sellers use both Etsy and their own website.',

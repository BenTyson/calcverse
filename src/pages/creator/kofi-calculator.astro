    question: 'How much does Ko-fi take from donations?',
    answer:
      'Free Ko-fi accounts pay a 5% platform fee on donations and memberships. Ko-fi Gold members ($6/month) pay 0% platform fees. All accounts pay payment processing fees (PayPal/Stripe) of approximately 2.9% + $0.30 per transaction.',
  },
  {
    question: 'Is Ko-fi Gold worth it?',
    answer:
      'Ko-fi Gold costs $6/month and removes the 5% platform fee. If you receive more than $120/month in donations and memberships, Gold pays for itself. Gold also includes features like a custom page URL, analytics, and scheduled posts.',
  },
  {
    question: 'How do Ko-fi memberships work?',
    answer:
      'Ko-fi memberships are recurring monthly payments from supporters. You can offer tiers with different benefits. Ko-fi takes 5% (or 0% with Gold) plus payment processing. Members can cancel anytime.',
  },
  {
    question: 'Does Ko-fi take a cut from shop sales?',
    answer:
      'No! Ko-fi takes 0% from shop sales - you only pay payment processing fees (around 2.9% + $0.30). This makes Ko-fi Shop very competitive for selling digital products, art, and merch.',
  },
  {
    question: 'Ko-fi vs Patreon - which is better?',
    answer:
      'Ko-fi has lower fees (5% vs 8-12%) and takes 0% from shop sales. Patreon has more features for large creators. Ko-fi is better for small creators and one-time donations. Many creators use both!',

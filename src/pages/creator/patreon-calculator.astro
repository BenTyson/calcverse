  {
    question: 'What is a good Patreon churn rate?',
    answer:
      'A healthy Patreon churn rate is 3-7% monthly. Above 10% indicates retention issues. To reduce churn, engage regularly with patrons, deliver promised content consistently, and create a sense of community. Some churn is normal—people\'s financial situations change.',
  },
  {
    question: 'How much can you realistically make on Patreon?',
